# This file defines hints to resolve version conflicts based on the
# multi-mission packages defined under deployments/common/image/common-env.
# Similar to build-hints.pip and every kernel,  hints to fix common
# conflicts should be added here instead of in the common-env .pip
# file which only declares the unconstrained basic need of the package,
# not any particular version which can cause inter-mission conflicts.

# ---- jupyter-client==7.4.1
# ---- jupyter-server==1.23.5
# ---- y-py==0.5.4
# ---- ypy-websocket==0.8.2
